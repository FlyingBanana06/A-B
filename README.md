# A-B
- This project is a game project, rewritten from a school assignment about string processing. 
- It was originally authored by Colten Chen, assignment details can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/@L39Ai4MITOCY2Aioz54q2g/2024PD1_HW7).

## Key Improvements
Below are the adjustments made to improve the original code:

### 1. Code Optimization
- Reduced unnecessary loops and shorten program total length.
- Enhanced readability with proper arranments, annotations and comments.

### 2. Random Test Case Generation
- Transformed the program from displaying every result into generating a single random test case, making it more practical for real-world use.

### 3. File Merging
- Consolidated the original 8 separate `.c` files into 3 for better manageability and focus.

### 4. Simplified Function References
- Eliminated redundant references and overlapping functions, reducing the overall complexity and number of functions.

### 5. Improved Game Rules
- Adjusted the game mechanics:
  - Reduced test case length from 50 characters to a range of 3â€“10 for better usability.
  - Refined game mode rules and replacement mechanics after multiple testing iterations.

### 6. Script Revision
- Rewrote the English script for better grammar and readability.
- Improved in-game explanations to make the program more beginner-friendly.

### 7. Enhanced Input Validation
- Added robust checks for invalid inputs to prevent crashes.

### 8. Reduced Variants and Simplified Arrays
- Minimized variable usage and eliminated the need for 2D arrays, simplifying the program's logic.

### 9. Miscellaneous Adjustments
- Addressed numerous small improvements and tested ideas throughout the rewriting process.

## Development Timeline
